# Googles Snapchat Upload Hack

Google employee going over Snapchat upload picture and how fast it was perceived due to how it was done on the backend

And you typed in your username or your email address, Even before you've entered in your password, like the chance probability, once you enter in your username that you're going to actually sign in is extremely high. So, why not just start, loading your account in the background? Not, not like sending it down to the desktop.

That would be a security issue. But like loaded into memory on the server like get it ready and prepare it. I just thought that was so fascinating and unintuitive. I was like Mike, why don't we just do that? But like we'll just upload the photo and like assume.

You're gonna upload the photo, but if you forget about it or don't end up uploading the photo we'll delete it right away. So what ended up happening was people would caption their, photo they'd press done or upload and you'd see those little progress bars just go across the page. It was lightning fast. Okay. We were no faster than anyone else at the time but by choosing 512 by 512 and kilobyte for the photo and uploading the photo in the background, it almost guaranteed that it was done by the time you captioned and everyone that used it was like How the hell is this thing so fast?
