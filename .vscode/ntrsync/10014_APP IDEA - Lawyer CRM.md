# APP IDEA - Lawyer CRM


i have another idea for another field a case content management system and client crm for lawyers, so whether ur lawyer or self representing you can use the app to manage ur case files and flow, for self representing it would guide you through the process so its not as overwhelming while at the same time, leaving clients in complete control of their data because whenever a client swithc representation it can take over 6 weeks for the data to reach the new lawyers, this would give them the ability to give the new team access on day one while at the same time for self representers obtaining legal  reps  while the case in progross the new lawyers could navigate the case with ease as everyhting is waiting for them, for lawyers it would be a compllete crm and case management system
